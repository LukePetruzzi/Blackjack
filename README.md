# Blackjack

This is a command line game of Blackjack! I wrote everything from scratch except the Card object, which I found online and made a couple tweaks to.

To play:
1) Clone the directory 
2) cd above the package
3) run this command: java blackjack/Blackjack

From the game:

Welcome to Blackjack!
The House plays with 6 decks, and stands on all 17s.
Blackjack pays 3:2, Ace and 10-value pair after a split is a non-Blackjack 21.
No Double Down on Blackjack, Unlimited Splits, No Insurance, No Surrenders.
This is a massive table with 10 seats, invite your friends.
Have fun!
